    "<b>InfoGAN:</b> Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Introduction:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be defined as the general problem of extracting value from large amounts of unlabeled data. The purpose of representation learning, a prominent method for unsupervised learning, is to develop a representation that exposes significant semantic traits as easily decodable elements using unlabeled data. Generative modeling drives a substantial portion of unsupervised learning research. The variational autoencoder (VAE) and the generative adversarial network (GAN) are two of the most popular generative models. These findings show that generative modeling combined with a reciprocal information cost may be an effective method for learning disentangled representations. Then we'll look at GANs, which are the foundation of InfoGAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Related Work:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised representation learning has a substantial corpus of research. The Skip-gram model, which inspired the skip-thought vectors and various techniques for unsupervised feature learning of images, has inspired many promising recent works. GANs were used to learn an image representation on code space that supports introductory linear algebra. Unlike the previously mentioned research that attempts to recover disentangled representations, InfoGAN does not require supervision. GAN learns a generator network G that generates samples from the generator distribution P. G by translating a noise variable z, P noise (z) into a sample G instead of explicitly assigning a probability to every x in the data distribution (z).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Mutual Information for Inducing Latent Codes:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The GAN algorithm employs a primary factored continuous input noise vector z, with no limits on how the generator might use it. Many domains break down naturally into a set of semantically significant causes of variation. Rather than employing a single unstructured noise vector, we propose splitting the input noise vector into two pieces in this paper. 1 z, which is viewed as a source of incompressible noise; 2 c, which we will refer to as the latent code, will target the data distribution's salient structured semantic properties. On the other hand, Standard GAN allows the generator to ignore the additional latent code c by finding a solution fulfilling P G (x|c) = P G (x).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Variational Mutual Information Maximization:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, because it requires access to the posterior P (c|x), the mutual information term I(c; G(z, c) is difficult to maximize directly. Fortunately, by defining an auxiliary distribution Q(c|x) to approximate P (c|x), we can lower it's bound: Variational Information Maximization is a strategy for lower limiting mutual information. L I, in particular, can be improved. As a result, L I (G, Q) can be added to GAN's objectives without affecting the training procedure, and the resulting technique is dubbed Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Networks (IMGN) (InfoGAN). When there are continuous variables in the latent code, a smaller is usually used to ensure that L I (G, Q), which now includes differential entropy, is on the same scale as GAN objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Experiments:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments' primary purpose is to see if mutual information can be efficiently maximized. The second goal is to see if InfoGAN can acquire disentangled and interpretable representations by using the generator to change only one latent factor at a time to see if changing that factor only causes one type of semantic variance in generated images. DC-IGN also employs this method to assess their learned representations on 3D image datasets, then compared using InfoGAN. We train InfoGAN on the MNIST dataset with a uniform categorical distribution on latent codes c Cat(K = 10, p = 0.1) to see if the mutual information between latent codes c and generated images G(z, c) can be maximized efficiently with the proposed method. The lower bound L I (G, Q) is immediately maximized to H(c) 2.30, indicating that the constraint is tight and maximum mutual information has been reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Mutual Information Maximization:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When the generator is not expressly urged to maximize the mutual information with the latent codes, we train a regular GAN with an auxiliary distribution Q as a baseline. We assume that Q reasonably approximates the genuine posterior P (c|x) because we utilize expressive neural networks to parametrize Q. So there is little mutual information between latent codes and generated images in standard GAN. Even while we have not found such a case in our studies, we highlight that there may be more reciprocal information between latent codes and output images with different neural network architectures. This comparison shows that there is no certainty that the generator will employ the latent codes in a typical GAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disentangled Representation:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "On MNIST, we chose to model the latent codes with one categorical code, c 1 Cat(K = 10, p = 0.1), which can model discontinuous variation in data, and two serial codes, c 2 and c 3 Unif(1, 1), which may capture continuous changes. Serial codes c 2 and c 3 record continuous style variations: c 2 models digit rotation while c 3 controls width. In this experiment, we used four categorical codes (c 1, c 2, c 3, c 4 Cat(K = 20, p = 0.05) and one continuous code (c 5 Unif(1, 1) to model the latent components. We then tested InfoGAN on the Street View House Number (SVHN) dataset. It is substantially more difficult to train an interpretable representation since it is noisy, contains photos of variable-resolution and distracting digits, and lacks many variations of the same item. We use four ten-dimensional categorical variables and two uniform continuous variables as latent codes in this experiment. To provide a direct comparison, we present the representation that most closely reflects prior supervised results out of 5 random runs for each factor.\n",

    "<b>Conclusion:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Networks is a representation learning algorithm introduced in this paper (InfoGAN). Generator: Instead of drawing from the actual data distribution, the \"sleep\" phase updates the auxiliary distribution Q by \"dreaming\" up samples from the current generator distribution. As a result, we can observe that the update step in the Wake-Sleep algorithm is the \"sleep\" phase update while optimizing the surrogate loss L I w.r.t. Q. When we optimize L I w.r.t., InfoGAN differs from Wake-Sleep. Our method can be understood as a \"Sleep-Sleep\" algorithm because InfoGAN also updates the generator during the \"sleep\" phase. This interpretation underscores the difference between InfoGAN and prior generative modeling techniques. The generator is encouraged to convey information in latent codes, implying that the same approach can be applied to other generative models."
